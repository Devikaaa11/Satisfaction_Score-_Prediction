        <h1>Satisfaction Score Prediction</h1>
        <h4>Welcome to the Satisfaction Score Prediction tool! </h4>
        <p>
             As a business owner or manager, you can assess the level of customer satisfaction based on three factors: 
            the number of items purchased, whether the customer has opted for a warranty extension, and the customerâ€™s loyalty score.  
            This prediction helps you understand customer satisfaction, improve your service, and boost customer retention.
        </p>
        <h4> Please enter the details below to predict the satisfaction score of a customer.</h4>
